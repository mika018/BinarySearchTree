# BinarySearchTree

This repository consists of two supporting modules, map.h and map.c which support maps from 
any key type to any value type simulating a binary search tree. A range of functions are provided including
insert, delete, compare, find and print.

You can also find one demo application simulating a contact list and a suitable Makefile.
